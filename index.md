There is a thriving community of operating system enthusiasts in
[Dresden](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dresden). We occasionally meet to
exchange ideas and have a cold drink.

If you are interested in joining our casual events, consider joining the
[announcement mailing list](https://www.freelists.org/list/ukvly-announce) or
follow [ukvly](https://twitter.com/ukvly) on Twitter.

For general discussion, join our chat room. You can find it via Matrix
([ukvly:matrix.org](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#ukvly:matrix.org)) or
as #ukvly on [Freenode IRC](https://webchat.freenode.net/).

Also check out our podcast on [syslog.show](https://syslog.show/).
